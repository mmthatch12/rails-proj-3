Ruby on Rails - Ruby & Ruby on Rails Basics - Introduction to Ruby on Rails - Project
Step One - Generate Rails App
Create a new rails app using the rails app generator
Scaffold the resources shown below using rails generators
Note: Don't forget to initialize and setup the database as part of your scaffolding process.

User

attribute	type
id	integer
email	string
active	boolean
created_at	datetime
updated_at	datetime
Task

attribute	type
id	integer
name	string
priority	integer
completed_at	datetime
created_at	datetime
updated_at	datetime
Step Two - Explain Rails MVC
Write all of your answers to the questions below in a separate readme named SOLUTIONS.md.

Rails MVC
First, start the rails server. Then, make a request to /tasks/new, fill out the form and submit it in order to create a new task.

What controller and action handles the data from the form submission?
What controller and action would be used if you did a GET request on the /users route?
Write out the step-by-step process that your rails application will take to render the tasks/new route.
What file is responsible for managing the mapping between your application and the tasks database table?
Rails RESTful Actions
Explain all 7 of the RESTful actions in Rails

List each action by its name
Explain which HTTP verbs pair with each action
Write a short sentence for each action that summarizes what it does
Step Three - Modify Routes
Our application has all 7 actions available for both Users and Tasks. We don't want that--we want to set limits on these resources.

Limit users resource to only allow index and show
Limit tasks resource to allow everything except destroy
remove the corresponding controller actions that are no longer routable
Step Four - Use Rails Console to Create a User
We removed the routes to create a User because we only want developers to be able to do that. The way our developers will create new users for this app is to use the rails console. Use the rails console to create 2 users. Paste the commands you used into the SOLUTIONS.md file.
